FriendFinder. But not in a creepy way.

I didn't get an image functionality working. I don't have a lot of experience with modals, since I didn't write them for the first project, and I'm honestly out of time.

The code I've written works on a local level, I'm not really certain about Heroku since I didn't have a ton of time to make it work. Hopefully it at least works for basic functionality.

Friend Finder works by taking in a user's answers to 10 questions and comparing them against answers in the database. It looks at the user's response to each question individually, and keeps a running tally of the best match for a user within the database.

It then returns a complete object of the person that a user is most compatible with, and adds the user to the database to see if a future friend will be more compatible with them.

The front end presently displays an alert with the person's name. Would have loved to a modal, but I'm out of time and I don't want to start a cycle when I'm too tired to pay attention tomorrow.
